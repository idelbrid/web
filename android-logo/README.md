### Android Logo in HTML/CSS

This small project is my result from half-copying the tutorial here: <a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo">http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo</a>. It will display a cute little android logo with minimal animations just using CSS and of course HTML.
